# ABOUT
DOOM: The Gallery Experience was created as an art piece designed to parody the wonderfully pretentious world of gallery openings.\
In this experience, you will be able to walk around and appreciate some fine art while sipping some wine and enjoying the complimentary hors d’oeuvres in the beautifully renovated and re-imagined E1M1 of id Software's DOOM (1993).\
Play it on [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/960452) or [my website](https://bobatealee.com/games/doom_tge/)!
