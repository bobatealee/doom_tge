**DOOM: The Gallery Experience** is an art piece parodying the wonderfully pretentious world of gallery openings.

In this experience, you will walk around and appreciate fine art while sipping wine and enjoying complimentary hors d’oeuvres in the beautifully renovated and re-imagined E1M1 of id Software's DOOM (1993).
